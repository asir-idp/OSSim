<h3>Example: Segmentation, partial allocation</h3>
<hr>
<p>The processes are divided into segments, each segment can be a
different size. The segments are loaded into memory independently, a
partition of the exact segment size is created. The division is
functional and is based on the logical process structure: data, stack,
code, etc ...</p>
<p>Not necessarily all the segments have to be loaded into memory
for the program to work, while a segment is not used it can be swapped out.</p>

<p>Processes are allocated in the table order. Memory size is 64
units, Operating System takes 4 units</p>
<p>Comments:</p>
<ul>
	<li>There is no internal fragmentation, partitions are always of
	the segment size</li>
	<li>The total size is 80 units and processes exceeds the available
	memory (60 units), but all processes are allocated completely or
	partially, and therefore they may all be working</li>
</ul>
