<h3>Example: Contiguous memory management with variable-sized
partitions (Defragmentation)</h3>
<hr>
<p>The first memory is not partitioned, partitions are created as
processes are loaded and have the same size of these, later partitions
are free (when a process completes, for example) and are occupied by new
processes, if a process is smaller than a partition, this is divided
into two parts, the first one as large as the process and the other the
remainder.</p>

<p>Processes are allocated in the table order.</p>
<p>Comments:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The process &quot;P7&quot; is allocated into a partition
	released by a completed process</li>
	<li>The latest process can not be load because there is no available
	partition large enough to accommodate it, however, on the whole memory
	there is enough space</li>
	<li>If memory is <b>defragmented </b> (right click on memory, pop
	up menu), all available space is grouped into a single partition and
	the latest process can be allocated</li>
</ul>
