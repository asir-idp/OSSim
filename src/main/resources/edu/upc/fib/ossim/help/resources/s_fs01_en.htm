<h3>Example: Linked Allocation with FAT. File System objects</h3>
<hr>
<p>In this example a folder tree is created with different types of
file system objects: folders, files and links.</p>
<p><b>Reminder 1:</b> the folders' color is green and the links are blue.
The files color is defined when created.</p>
<p><b>Reminder 2:</b> In the simulation the folder size is 1 block,
while the links do not occupy disk space, they are simply entries in its
folder data.</p>

<p>Comments:</p>
<ul>
	<li>File system root is &quot;C:&quot; and path separator is
	&quot;\&quot;</li>
	<li>In each new folder, two links are automatically created
	&quot;.&quot; and &quot;..&quot; pointing to the directory itself and
	its parent respectively</li>
	<li>First block of the different objects corresponds with the
	first entry in its FAT table</li>
	<li>If a file referenced by a link is deleted (link1 -&gt;
	file1.txt), link remains but become unusable</li>
	<li>If a folder is deleted, all the objects hanging from it are also
	deleted</li>
</ul>
