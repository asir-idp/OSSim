<h3>Example: The improved elevator 1. Circular SCAN</h3>
<hr>
<p>The head movement does not depend on requests, it scans in a
single direction, from the outer to the inner cylinder, the requests are
served as they are found.</p>
<p><b>Reminder</b>: disk geometry is one platter, 16 cylinders, 12
sectors per cylinder, 192 sectors in total.</p>

<p>The head is initially positioned at sector 90 (Cylinder 7),
moving forward innermost cylinders.</p>
<p>All requests arrive in the table order at time 0.</p>
<p>Comments:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Innermost request is in cylinder 12, but the head continues until
	the last cylinder.</li>
	<li><i>(Improvement on SCAN)</i> At the time it reaches the last
	cylinder, as it has just served the innermost requests, and those that remain are
	at outermost cylinders, so the head moves directly to the first cylinder and
	starts again</li>
</ul>
