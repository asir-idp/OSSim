<h3>Example: Contiguous memory management with variable-sized
partitions (Swap)</h3>
<hr>
<p>The first memory is not partitioned, partitions are created as
processes are loaded and have the same size of these, later partitions
are free (when a process completes, for example) and are occupied by new
processes, if a process is smaller than a partition, this is divided
into two parts, the first one as large as the process and the other the
remainder.</p>
<p>Memory has a finite size, only a limited number of processes can
be in memory at once, but the <b>swap space</b> (backing store) allows to
keep some of these processes, generally the less active, and leave
available memory for the new ones. Swapped out processes are allocated
back into memory when needed.</p>

<p>Processes are allocated in the table order.</p>
<p>Comments:</p>
<ul>
	<li>There is no internal fragmentation, partitions are always of
	the size of the process</li>
	<li>The last two processes (&quot;P7&quot; and &quot;P8&quot;) can
	not be loaded because memory is full</li>
	<li>If some process is <b>swapped out)</b> that will free up
	enough space to allocate. For example &quot;P2&quot; and &quot;P4&quot;
	(right click on the process, pop up menu)</li>
	<li>To allocate back processes that are swapped must make room in
	memory, for example swapping &quot;P6&quot;. Then &quot;P2&quot; and
	&quot;P4&quot; may be <b> swapped in</b> (right click on memory, pop up
	menu)</li>
</ul>
